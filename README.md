# Distracted-driver-detection

In this project a CNN model is trained to classify the images captured by dashboard camera into 10 different classes based on their activity while they are driving such as whether they 'driving safe','texting','drinking','reaching behind',etc.

The dataset is obtained from kaggle. Here is the link to the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection

In this project no pretrained model was used and various models were tried and trained.The best model was able to achive 99% accuracy on both training and validation data.

Some of the results predicted by our model are as follows:
